###### Do your remote employees know what to expect?
Once all the papers are signed, and everyone has been introduced to one another, it is time for your new employee to get to work. But, where to begin? They will most likely be very confused and maybe a little insecure. This is where you jump in. If you haven't done it up to this point, this is an excellent opportunity to fix that and create an employee handbook. Come up with a template,  a sort of onboarding checklist, that you will adjust accordingly and fill this document with useful information about the position, responsibilities, and expectations.

You should also add information about the company, their direct manager, team members, and everything else you might find interesting. Your new remote workers have a lot to learn.

###### Knowledge is power, and they need to learn
Most HR managers make a mistake when making the onboarding plan and fail to include the big picture. In addition to learning about the company, hierarchy, communication tools, and messaging software, they also need to understand everything about their role.

What do we mean by it? Well, they should know what the planned goals for their department and their position are. What will be expected of them and how to achieve that. How they can improve the position, and in which direction the company is heading.

Introducing new recruits to their role inside the big puzzle that is your company is a great first step into turning them into productive and meaningful employees. It is also a great way to increase your retention rate - if they believe they are valued and irreplaceable, they are less likely to quit.
