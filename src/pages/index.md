          Our HR Consultants have experience in a number of different setting up
          global tech teams. This helps us to create documents that match the
          tone and nature of your business. We don’t use a ‘one size fits all’
          approach, but work with you to create documents which protect your
          business but reflect your company ethos. It’s essential to have these
          in place not only to comply with legislation, but to support your
          business strategy and create a consistent approach as your business
          grows to keep up with competitors.

          As workforces become increasingly globalized, cross-border
          communication has become a critical challenge for HR teams to address.
          According to a survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit
          (EIU), people management is among the top current challenges for
          senior and C-level executives, second only to slow growth in key
          markets.

    content: >-
      Managing productivity in a distributed environment requires more of a
      bottom line approach. If features are being shipped, customer service
      tickets are being closed and task lists are turning over, it’s usually a
      sure sign that things are getting done. But getting there isn't easy or
      obvious. We can help.
